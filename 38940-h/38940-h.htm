or Lidinillah, that is to say, "the defender of the religion of God,"
eighth Sultan and first Caliph of Córdova. Under Abd-er-Rahman III. the
Mohammedan empire in Spain attained the height of its glory), 886-961.
"<i>Fifty years have passed since I became Caliph. Riches, honors,
pleasures&mdash;I have enjoyed all. In this long time of seeming
happiness I have numbered the days on which I have been happy.
Fourteen.</i>" Though these sad words correctly express the spirit of the

<p>He died on the Fourth of July, the anniversary of the Declaration of
Independence; and it is thought that his last words were suggested by
the noise of the celebration. Some say his last words were, "Jefferson
survives;" if so, he was mistaken, for Jefferson passed away at an
earlier hour the same day.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Adams</span> (John Quincy, sixth
President of the United States), 1767-1848. "<i>It is the last of earth! I

in the Capitol, he was struck with paralysis, and died two days later.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Addison</span> (Joseph, poet and
essayist), 1672-1719. "<i>See in what peace a Christian can die!</i>"
These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
words were addressed to Lord Warwick, an accomplished but dissolute
youth, to whom Addison was nearly related.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Adrian</span> or
<span class="smcap">Hadrian</span> (Publius Ælius, the Roman Emperor),
76-138. "<i>O my poor soul, whither art thou going?</i>"</p>

<p>Adrian wrote both in Greek and Latin. Among his Latin poems (preserved
by Spartianus, who wrote his life), are these lines addressed to his own
soul:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Animula vagula blandula,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Hospes comesque corporis,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Quæ nunc abibis in loca?<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Pallidula, rigida, nudula,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Nec, ut soles, dabis jocos.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soul of me! floating and flitting, and fond!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou and this body were house-mates together;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou begone now, and whither?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pallid, and naked, and cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to laugh, nor be glad, as of old.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Adrian is known in history as one of the greatest of the Roman Emperors.
It is hardly too much to say that, by his progress through all the
provinces and his policy of peace, he was the consolidater of the empire
founded a century and a half before by Augustus. He was the author of
the Roman Wall between England and Scotland; he beautified the city of
Athens; he founded the modern Adrianople; he built for his own mausoleum
what is now the Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4"
id="Page_4">4</a></span> of St. Anglo at Rome. He was also a patron of
the fine arts and of literature.</p>

<p>Of the famous lines, "The Dying Adrian's Address to His Soul," no fewer
than one hundred and sixteen translations into English have been
collected, the translators including Pope, Prior, Byron, Dean Merivale,
and the late Earl of Carnarvon. It should be added that Pope's familiar
version, beginning "Vital spark of heav'nly flame," is a paraphrase
rather than a translation. I quote Prior's version:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Poor little, quivering, fluttering thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Must we no longer live together?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dost thou prune thy trembling wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To take thy flight thou know'st not whither?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy humorous vein, thy pleasing folly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lie all neglected, all forgot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pensive, wavering, melancholy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou dread'st and hop'st thou know'st not what."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the only certain composition of Adrian that has been preserved,
though he is reported to have attempted many forms of literature. The
authenticity of a letter ascribed to him with a reference to the
Christians, is open to grave doubt. But now the sands of Egypt, which
are daily yielding up so many secrets of antiquity, have given us what
purports to be a private letter addressed by the Emperor Adrian to his
successor, Antoninus Pius, and&mdash;what is more interesting&mdash;it
is written, like the address to his soul, in view of his approaching
death. Unfortunately the papyrus is very fragmentary, but<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> its general
meaning seems clear. We have evidently only the commencement of an
elaborate epistle. After the assertion that his death is neither
unexpected, nor lamentable, nor unreasonable, he says that he is
prepared to die, though he misses his correspondent's presence and
loving care. He goes on:</p>

<p>"I do not intend to give the conventional reasons of philosophy for this
attitude, but to make a plain statement of facts.... My father by birth
died at the age of forty, a private person, so that I have lived more
than half as long again as my father, and have reached about the same
age as that of my mother when she died."</p>

<p>All this accords with the known facts about Adrian. He died at the age
of sixty-two, after a long illness, during which he was assiduously
tended by Antoninus. Just before the end he withdrew to Baiae, leaving
Antoninus in charge at Rome. His father had died when his son was ten
years old; of his mother we know nothing. <i>Prima facie</i>, there is no
improbability that letters of Adrian should be in circulation in Egypt,
which he visited at least once. His freedman Phlegon is reported to have
published a collection of them after his death.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it should be frankly admitted that some suspicious
circumstances attach to the letter. Of the antiquity of the papyrus
there is no doubt, for the handwriting cannot be later than the end of
the second century <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;d.</span>, bringing it within
sixty years (at farthest) from Adrian's death. But<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> it is written
as a school exercise on the back of a taxing-list, which naturally gives
rise to the suspicion that it may be merely the composition of the
schoolmaster. The actual form of the document is interesting. At the top
are about fifteen lines, written in a clear cursive, or running, hand.
Below, the first five lines are repeated in large, irregular uncials, or
capital letters. It is impossible not to recognize here an exercise set
by a schoolmaster and a copy begun by a pupil.</p>

<p>The papyrus is one of the many found by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt while
excavating in the Fayoum on account of the Egypt Exploration Fund, and
appears in the volume issued by the Græco-Roman Branch of Egypt
Exploration Fund, called "Fayoum Towns and Their Papyri."</p>

<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Agis</span> (King of Lacedæmonia,
strangled by order of the Ephori. He was charged with subverting the
laws of his country, but was in reality a brave and good man according
to the light of the age in which he lived. He died with great calmness
and courage),&mdash;240. "<i>Weep not for me.</i>"</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Agrippa</span> (Henricus Cornelius,
German physician, theologian and astrologer, skilled in alchemy and
occult sciences), 1486-1535. "<i>Begone, thou wretched beast, which hast
utterly undone me.</i>" The story is that he was always accompanied by a
devil in the shape of a black dog. When he perceived that death<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> was near he
wished, by repentance, to free his soul from the guilt of witchcraft,
and so took off the collar from his dog's neck. This collar was covered
with magical characters. As he removed the collar he muttered these, his
last words: "Begone, thou wretched beast, which hast utterly undone me."
The familiar dog disappeared with Agrippa's death, and was never more
seen. This curious story was for a long time believed by the common
people, and is to be found in one form or another in many old books.</p>

<p>Agrippa lectured on theology at Cologne, Pisa, Turin, and Pavia, and
practiced medicine in France. Henry VIII. invited him to England, but he
preferred the court of Margaret of Austria, regent of the Low Countries.
He died poor, leaving behind him a number of books, and among them "On
the Vanity of the Sciences," which has been translated into English and
other languages.</p>


<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Agrippina</span> (mother of the
Emperor Nero. She was one of the worst of women, and was condemned to
death by her own son),&mdash;60. "<i>Strike here! Level your rage against
the womb which gave birth to such a monster.</i>" These words she said,
placing her hand over her womb, to the man sent to dispatch her.</p>

(Francis-Augustus-Charles-Emmanuel, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and
Gotha. He married Queen Victoria, his cousin, the tenth of February,
1840), 1819-1861. "<i>I have had wealth, rank and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> power, but if these were all I had,
how wretched I should be!</i>" A few moments later he repeated the
familiar lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rock of Ages cleft for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me hide myself in Thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Inscription on the "Memorial Cairn" on a high mountain overlooking
Balmoral Palace: "To the beloved memory of Albert the great and good
Prince Consort, erected by his broken-hearted widow, Victoria R., 21
August, 1862." Upon another dressed slab, a few inches below the above,
is this quotation: "He being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a
long time: for his soul pleased the Lord, therefore hasted he to take
him away from among the wicked."</p>

<p class="source"><i>Wisdom of Solomon, chap. iv: 13, 14.</i></p>

<p>One year after Prince Albert died, the Queen erected a costly mausoleum
in the grounds of Frogmore House, which is legally a part of the domain
of Windsor Castle. The mausoleum is cruciform, eighty feet long, with
transepts of seventy feet. As soon as it was completed and consecrated
by the Bishop of Oxford, the remains of the Prince Consort were there
deposited. Over the entrance is a Latin inscription, which in English
reads as follows:</p>

<p class="center">

HAS CAUSED TO BE DEPOSITED IN THIS SEPULCHER.<br />

to whom it is believed she was privately married.</p>

<p>In the church of Santa Croce, Florence, reposes the body of Alfieri, and

Archdeacon to assist in the services at his funeral.</p>

<p>He had expressed a wish to be buried in St. Martin's churchyard. The
spot chosen for his grave is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">10</a></span> beneath a yew-tree on the brow of the hill

has a better right to dispose of a man's life than himself; and he, not
others, should determine how. As for any indignities offered to my body,
or silly reflections on my faith and morals, they are (as they always
were) things indifferent to me. I think, though contrary to the common
way of thinking, I wrong no man by this, and hope it is not offensive to
that Eternal Being that formed me and the world; and as by this I injure
no man, no man can be reasonably offended. I solicitously recommend
myself to the Eternal and Almighty Being, the God of Nature, if I have
done amiss. But perhaps I have not; and I hope this thing will never be

his chest, which he had felt slightly on the preceding day, before and
after bathing. He composed himself to sleep for a short time; but the

Their usual medical attendant, Dr. Bucknill, was sent for, and found Dr.
Arnold lying on his back&mdash;his countenance much as usual&mdash;his
pulse, though regular, was very quick, and there was cold perspiration
on the brow and cheeks. He apologized in a cheerful manner for troubling
Dr. Bucknill at so early an hour, and inquired as to the nature and
danger of his illness: he was told it was a spasm of the heart. The
physician quitted the house to furnish himself with remedies. On his

before you left, I do not know how I can bear it.' He again questioned
Dr. Bucknill as to the danger of his complaint&mdash;he was told of his
danger&mdash;inquired as to the remedies, and on being told, answered,
'Ah! very well.' The physician, who was dropping the laudanum into a

ear of his Catherine, that when she stood to hear him, he, looking upon
her most affectionately, said, 'My beloved! they are <i>not mine</i>.
<i>No!</i> they are <i>not</i> mine!' He told her they would not be
parted; he should always be about her to take care of her. A little
before his death, Mrs. Blake asked where he would be buried, and whether
a dissenting minister or a clergyman of the Church of England should
read the service. To which he answered, that as far as his own feelings
were concerned, she might bury him where she pleased. But that as
father, mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"

six in the summer evening, a calm and painless withdrawal of breath; the

assassination of President Lincoln, a private dinner-party was in
progress in a back room at Wormley's restaurant, in Washington, at which
were present General Baird, Robert Johnson, the Hon. Samuel J. Randall,
John Morrissey, John F. Coyle, editor of "The National Intelligencer,"

had been out on the street, returned and stated that the President had
been shot at Ford's Theatre. The news created great consternation in the
party, who at first thought the waiter was drunk or crazy. Later, when
they were assured that it was a fact, and that John Wilkes Booth was
accused of the crime, John F. Coyle, with blanched features and
trembling lips, said: "My God, gentlemen! This very day I met John
Wilkes Booth on the market-space. He was on a bay mare, and rode up to
me and handed me a sealed envelope, saying, as he did so, 'If you hear
of me within twenty-four hours, publish this; if you do not hear of me
within that time, destroy this,' and he rode away. Here is the package,"
continued Mr. Coyle, producing a letter envelope from his pocket; "what
shall I do with it?" "Destroy it at once," said Mr. Randall. "They will
hang anybody who knows anything about the assassination, no matter how
innocently he may have come by the knowledge; don't open it&mdash;burn
it up just as it is!" "Yes," said Mr. Morrissey, "burn it up, for

water was poured upon them, and the two were mixed into a paste, which
was afterward put into the fire and burned again.</p>

in silver, or in any other substance; but restore it to the earth as soon
as possible; for what can be more desirable than to be mixed with the
earth, which gives birth and nourishment to everything excellent and
good? I have always hitherto borne an affection to men, and I feel that
I should now gladly be incorporated with that which is beneficial to
men. And now my soul seems to be leaving me, in the same manner as, it
is probable, it begins to leave others. If, therefore, any one of you is
desirous of touching my right hand, or is willing to see my face, while
it has life, let him come near me; but when I shall have covered it, I
request of you, my sons, let no man, not even yourselves, look upon my
body. Summon, however, all the Persians, and the allies, to my tomb, to
rejoice for me, as I shall then be safe from suffering any evil, whether
I be with the divine nature, or be reduced to nothing. As many as come,
do not dismiss until you have bestowed on them whatever favors are
customary at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the funeral of a rich man. And remember this, as my last admonition: by
doing good to your friends, you will be able also to punish your
enemies. Farewell, dear children, and say farewell to your mother as
from me; farewell, all my friends, present and absent.</i>"</p>

<p>The punishment inflicted upon Damiens for his attack upon the king was
horrible. The hand by which he attempted the murder was burned at a slow
fire; the fleshy parts of his body were then torn off by pincers; and
finally, he was dragged about for an hour by four strong horses, while
into his numerous wounds were poured molten lead, resin, oil and boiling
wax. Towards night, the poor wretch expired, having by an effort of will
almost superhuman, kept his resolution of not confessing who were his
accomplices if, indeed, he had any. His remains were immediately burned,
his house was destroyed, his father, wife and daughter were banished
from France forever, and his brothers and sisters compelled to change
their names.&mdash;<i>Chambers.</i></p>

<p>From his arrest to his death&mdash;nearly three months&mdash;he was in
torture; bound in chains, and frequently<span class="pagenum"><a

there treated as the North American savages were wont to treat their
victims, and with the aid of more skillful appliances for inflicting
pain than Indians have. By a circuitous journey he was taken to the
place of execution, guarded by a small army, all Paris ready to see the
show. For half an hour he was kept waiting in view of the preparations
for his murder, and in the presence of an immense assemblage&mdash;many
of them delicate ladies of high rank&mdash;he was bound naked upon a
table placed on a high platform. The ladies and gentry looked on with
joy; those who had succeeded, through influence in gaining good
positions for seeing the spectacle, saw his right hand (the one with
which he had struck the King) burned off; the pieces of flesh torn from
him by red-hot pincers, and melted lead and resin poured into his
wounds; a powerful horse was attached to each of his four limbs, but it
was impossible to tear him to pieces, and a request was sent to cut the
muscles; but not until the request was repeated was permission given,
and he did not expire until both legs and one arm had been torn from the
body. His execution lasted over an hour. His body was burned, his house
purchased and destroyed; and the leaders in this murder were
munificently rewarded. To the two judges who pronounced sentence were
given life pensions of six thousand francs a year; the lawyers, the
clerks, the torturers and the executioners also had their reward....
Damiens was a monomaniac of the style<span class="pagenum"><a

monomaniac, for he was a pious fanatic&mdash;a Jacobinist&mdash;and in
his pocket were found a copy of the New Testament, and thirty gold
pieces. He had no accomplices, no plan, no motives that could appeal to
a sane mind, any more than had Guiteau.</p>

<p>It was the desire of President Bogran to spare Gen. Delgado's life if
possible, and any pretext would have been readily seized upon to give
him an opportunity of saving himself and at the same time vindicate the
tribunal which had condemned him. The President sent a messenger to him
to say that if he would promise to never again take up arms against
Honduras he should receive a pardon. The soldier was too brave to accept
even his life on these terms, and he sent back word that he would see
Honduras in an even more tropical climate than she now enjoys before he
would accept his pardon on such a pledge. When his answer was received
there was nothing left but to prepare for the execution.</p>

<p>On the morning of their execution the men were taken to a point near

four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
condemned men were led to them. They accepted their positions as easily
and gracefully as if they were in boxes at the opera, and not a face was
blanched, not a nerve quivered. Gen. Delgado asked and received
permission to order the guard to fire, which he did, first requesting
them not to shoot him in the face, but in the breast. There was no
rattle, no scattering reports, but one sharp, stunning report. The four
men for half a second remained in an upright position, as if still
unhurt, and then rolled over, limp and bloody, dead. The soldiers had
complied with Gen. Delgado's request, for three balls had penetrated his
breast.</p>

which was endeavored to be thrown upon him. He came to his brother's

was given to the populace. They rose in arms; they broke open the doors
of the prison; they pulled out the two brothers, and a thousand hands
vied who should first be imbrued in their blood. Even their death did
not satiate the brutal rage of the multitude. They exercised on the dead
bodies of those virtuous citizens indignities too shocking to be
recited; and till tired with their own fury, they permitted not the
friends of the deceased to approach or to bestow on them the honors of a
funeral, silent and unattended.</p>

Dr. Donne was formerly Dean of St. Paul's. Among other preparations for
his death, he ordered an urn to be cut in wood, on which was to be
placed a board of the exact height of his body. He then caused himself
to be tied up in a winding-sheet. Thus shrouded, and standing with his

discover his death-like face, he caused his portrait to be taken, which,
when finished, was placed near his bedside, and there remained to the

noticed them, and said, "<i>Those are the spirits of my little girls, Rosa
and Annita, who have come to see their father die. Be kind to them, and
feed them when I am dead.</i>" It is thought that his mind was wandering.</p>

<p>He gave minute and positive orders to be cremated immediately after
death. The urn containing his ashes was to be placed under the orange
tree that shaded the tombs of his two little girls. But this wish,
cherished for years, was disregarded. He was embalmed and exposed to the
gaze of the crowds who hastened to Caprera on hearing of his death. The
excuse was, that it would have been impossible to have burned his body
in the way he indicated, with the aromatic woods that grow near the spot
he had chosen, as the ashes would have been mixed with the burned wood.
But this was only an excuse and nothing more, for Dr. Praudina, to whom
Garibaldi wrote on this subject five years before his death, had
prepared the sheet of asbestos that would have kept together the
precious ashes. The true reason for this violation of the great man's
order was the desire of the Republican party to have the remains brought
to Rome and buried on the Janiculum, where from time to time political
demonstrations might be made. When once a man is dead it is very

brow," none surpassed him in admiration, and possibly in ability. It was
not strange that Coleridge selected him to complete the development of
that "Spiritual Philosophy" which was the great unaccomplished work of
his life. Upon Coleridge's death, Mr. Green abandoned all his London
work, threw aside the distinctions and emoluments of professional life,
rewards that would surely increase from year to year, and devoted his
whole time to philosophy and incidental studies to qualify himself for
carrying out the commission of Coleridge. The story of his death has
been told by one of his colleagues at St. Thomas's Hospital, one whose
fame is familiar to the profession, Mr. Simon. "Not even the last agony
of death," said Mr. Simon, "ruffled his serenity of mind, or rendered
him unthoughtful of others. No terrors, no selfish regrets, no
reproachful memories were there. The few tender parting words which he
had yet to speak he spoke. And to the servants who were gathered
grieving round him, he said, 'While I have breath, let me thank you for
all your kindness and attention to me.' Next, to his doctor who quickly
entered,&mdash;his neighbor and old pupil, Mr. Carter,&mdash;he
significantly, and pointing to the region of his heart, said,
'Congestion,' after which he in silence set his finger to his wrist, and
visibly noted to himself the successive feeble pulses which were just
between him and death. Presently he said 'Stopped,' and this was the
very end. It was as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"

<p>Guiteau published, while in jail, his autobiography, through the medium
of a metropolitan newspaper. It is full of repetitions and minute

the fact that, in spite of his assertions to the contrary, his motive
was not political, but was the gratification of an inordinate vanity. In
one place Guiteau says: "During the week preceding the President's
removal, I read the papers carefully. I thought it all over in detail. I
thought just what people would talk, and thought what a<span

then prepared myself. I sent to Boston for a copy of my book, 'The

notoriety that the act of removing the President would give me, and I
wished the book to go out to the public in proper shape." It is now

<p>A subaltern of the imperial army, observing the respect with which the
unknown officer was treated by his few followers, naturally concluded
that he was a person of importance, and called out to a musketeer:
"Shoot that man, for I am sure he is an officer of high rank." The
soldier immediately fired, and the King's left arm fell powerless by his
side. At this moment a wild cry was raised, "The King bleeds! the King
is wounded!" "It is nothing!" shouted<span class="pagenum"><a

the pain soon brought on faintness, and he desired the Duke of Lauenburg
in French to lead him out of the throng. Whilst the duke was endeavoring
to withdraw him without being noticed by the troops, a second shot
struck Gustavus and deprived him of his little remaining strength. "I
have enough, brother," he said in a feeble voice to the duke; "try to
save your own life." At the same moment he fell from his horse, and in a

<p>As Tuesday marked the turning point in his disease, so it was the time
from which evidences of consciousness began to disappear. Since that
time there were few lucid intervals, and it is doubtful, with the single
exception of Tuesday afternoon, when his little girl was taken to his

all of his surroundings. The last words he spoke were to Mrs. Harrison
in answer to a question, but his voice was then almost inaudible and his
manner indicated that it required a concentration of effort to grasp the
import of the wife's question and frame a reply.</p>

<p>The strange and mysterious history and sad death of Kaspar Hauser called
forth the deepest interest and sympathy throughout Europe. He was
discovered in the streets of Nuremberg in 1828, a lad about sixteen,
knowing almost nothing of the world, and able to speak but two or three
words of any language, and of the meaning of these he had but a dim
understanding. He had with him a letter purporting to be written by a
Bavarian peasant, declaring that Hauser had been left at his door, and
had been cared for by him. It was gradually ascertained that the youth
had been confined from infancy in a dark vault, so small that one could
not stand, and could move only slightly in its enclosure. He had never
tasted any food but bread and water, which had been brought to him by an
unknown man while he was sleeping. Hauser was cared for by a number of
generous and sympathetic patrons, among whom was Lord Stanhope; and his
mental and physical condition was studied by the scientific men of the
time. In 1833 he was invited to a meeting with a stranger who promised
to reveal to him the secret of his strange condition, and to tell him
who he was, but when Hauser was reading a document given him, this
stranger suddenly wounded him with a dagger, causing his death within
three days. See interesting history of the "Nuremberg Foundling" in

That night he was heard walking about his room nearly the whole night,
apparently in great agitation. It was in those wakeful hours he settled
his resolve. He was dressed and out of his room early the next morning
(22d June), and walked down, before breakfast, to Rivière, a gunmaker in
Oxford Street, near Regent Street. Here he bought one of a pair of
pistols. He came home about 9 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span>,
breakfasted alone, then went to his painting-room, and probably wrote

rooms, about 10:30 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span>, they tried the
door&mdash;it was locked&mdash;and he called out very fiercely, "Who's
there?" A few minutes after, as if regretting the tone in which he had
spoken, he came up to his mother's room, kissed her affectionately, and
lingered about the room as if he had something to say. But he said
little, except to ask her to call that day on an old friend (one of the
executors he had just named in his will) and, returned to his
painting-room, deliberately wrote in his journal:&mdash;</p>

<p>While the coach stopped, the attendants with the exception of two, went
on before; one of these two advanced to clear the way, the other stopped
to fasten his garter. At that instant a wild-faced, red-haired man in a
cloak, who had followed the coach from the Louvre, approached the side
where the king sat, as if endeavoring to push his way, like other
passengers, between the coach and the shops. Suddenly putting one foot
on a spoke of the wheel, he drew a knife, and struck the king, who was
reading a letter, between the second and third rib, a little above the
heart. "I am wounded," cried the king, as the<span class="pagenum"><a

the stroke had not been effectual, repeated it. The second blow went
directly to the heart; the blood gushed from the wound and from his

<p>In January, 1555, he was condemned on three charges: for maintaining
the lawfulness of clerical marriage, for defending divorce and for
denying transubstantiation. He called the mass "the iniquity of the
devil." He was sentenced to die at the stake in Gloucester, whither he
was conveyed. He met his death firmly and cheerfully. To a friend
bewailing his lot, the martyr replied in the oft-quoted words, "Death is
bitter, and life is sweet, but alas! consider that death to come is more
bitter, and life to come is more sweet." In another conversation he
said, "I am well, thank God; and death to me for Christ's<span

welcome." His martyrdom was witnessed by a large throng of people. The
martyr was forbidden to address the crowd. A real or pretended pardon
being promised if he would recant, he spurned it away, saying, "If you
love my soul, away with it." His agony was greatly prolonged and
increased by the slow progress of the fire on account of the green
faggots, which had to be rekindled three times before they did their
work.</p>

distributed prizes.</p>

cheering of the people. He wore civilian attire, and appeared to be in
excellent health and spirits. In distributing the prizes, his

Majesty made a speech which he concluded by saying:</p>

court carriages that were waiting. He sat on the right of Lieut.-Gen.
Ponziovaglia, his chief aide.</p>

societies gathered round and cheered the King enthusiastically. His
Majesty, smiling and acknowledging the demonstration, brought the
carriage to a temporary halt.</p>

<p>"It was beginning to start again when three revolver shots rang out,
startling every one. The horses were frightened and began to rear, and
almost simultaneously the people saw that the King had fallen into the
arms of his aides, bleeding from his neck and breast.</p>

<p>"The murderer was instantly recognized and the enraged people fell upon
him with the evident intention of killing him. He was kicked, cuffed and
beaten with canes. He would not have escaped alive if carbiniers and
members of the fire brigade had not rushed through the crowd and seized
the culprit. They formed a cordon round him and conveyed him to jail

Monza and solemnly blessed the corpse.</p>

<p>"Each of the three bullets had hit the King. One struck him on the left
collarbone, another between the fifth and sixth ribs on the right side,
while the one that inflicted the fatal wound entered the heart.</p>

<p>"As he fell the King said to his aide: 'It is nothing.' These were the
last words he uttered, and he was dead when the carriage arrived at the
palace.</p>

<p>"The body was borne tenderly up a long flight of steps and carried into
a chamber and placed on a bed. The King's eyes were open, but he gave no
sign of life. The Queen threw herself on the body of her husband,
alternately calling to him in tones, filled with anguish, and praying
the doctors to tell her the truth. When they were convinced that the
King was dead the Queen submitted to be led gently away. The surgeons
then removed the King's clothing and examined his wounds. The Queen
afterward returned and kept her vigil beside the body, praying until a
late hour.</p>

revolver. Several attempted to seize the weapon, but Bressi fired before
they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>

took a wet broom faggot, and kneeled down thereon, and read the
fifty-first Psalm till he came to these words, 'The sacrifice of God is
a contrite spirit; a contrite and a broken heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise!'</p>

<p>"Then said the sheriff, 'There is a letter from the Queen. If thou wilt
recant thou shalt live; if not, thou shalt be burned.' 'No,' quoth
William, 'I will not recant, God willing.' Then William rose and went to
the stake, and stood upright to it. Then came one Richard Ponde, a
bailiff, and made fast the chain about William.</p>

<p>"Then said master Brown, 'There is not wood enough to burn a leg of
him.' Then said William, 'Good people! pray for me, and make speed and

said to him in the presence of courtiers who ill concealed their
surprise: "I come to tell Your Majesty, that whenever it shall please
God to take you from us, I will be to your son what I have been to you,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
The final disposition of the remains of James II. is involved in some
uncertainty. Stanley in Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey says:
"The body had been placed in the Chapel of the English Benedictines at
Paris, and deposited there in the vain hope that, at some future time,
they would be laid with kingly pomp at Westminster among the graves of
the Plantagenets and Tudors." Clarke, in his Life of James II. says that
at his burial the rites of the Church of England were not used, but this
is contradicted by the account preserved in Herald's College. The King's
brains, it is said, were deposited in an urn of bronze-gilt standing
upon the monument raised to him in the Chapel of the Scotch College in
the Rue des Fossés Saint Victor. This, according to a correspondent of
the Notes and Queries, Vol. ii, p. 281, was "smashed, and the contents
scattered about during the French Revolution." Pettigrew, in his
Chronicles of the Tombs, says: "It is conjectured that portions of the
King's body were collected together, and entombed at St. Germain en
Laye, soon after the termination of the war in 1814; but it being
necessary to rebuild the church, the remains were exhumed and
re-interred in 1824."</p>

<p>The following curious account was given in 1840 by Mr. Fitzsimmons, an
Irish gentleman upward of eighty years of age, who taught French and
English at Toulouse and claimed to be a runaway monk:</p>

<p>"I was a prisoner in Paris, in the convent of the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span> English Benedictines
in the Rue St. Jacques, during part of the Revolution. In the year 1793
or 1794, the body of King James II. of England (died 1701) was in one of
the chapels there, where it had been deposited some time, under the
expectation that it would one day be sent to England for interment in
Westminster Abbey. It had never been buried. The body was in a wooden
coffin, inclosed in a leaden one; and that again inclosed in a second
wooden one, covered with black velvet. While I was a prisoner the
<i>sans-culottes</i> broke open the coffins to get at the lead to cast into
bullets. The body lay exposed nearly a whole day. It was swaddled like a
mummy, bound tight with garters. The <i>sans-culottes</i> took out the body,
which had been embalmed. There was a strong smell of vinegar and
camphor. The corpse was beautiful and perfect. The hands and nails were
very fine. I moved and bent every finger. I never saw so fine a set of
teeth in my life. A young lady, a fellow prisoner, wished much to have a
tooth; I tried to get one out for her, but could not, they were so
firmly fixed. The feet also were very beautiful. The face and cheeks
were just as if he were alive. I rolled his eyes; the eye-balls were
perfectly firm under my finger. The French and English prisoners gave
money to the <i>sans-culottes</i> for showing the body. The trouserless
crowd said he was a good <i>sans-culotte</i>, and they were going to put
him into a hole in the public churchyard like other <i>sans-culottes</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
and he was carried away, but where the body was thrown I never heard.
King George IV. tried all in his power to get tidings of the body, but
could not. Around the chapel were several wax moulds of the face hung
up, made probably at the time of the king's death, and the face of the
corpse was very like them. The body had been originally kept at the
palace of St. Germain, from whence it was brought to the convent of the
Benedictines."</p>

like him amazingly. My only introduction to him was our common
admiration of Keats, whose memory he cherishes most affectionately, and
of whom he is never tired of speaking when he finds one who listens with
gladness. I sat in his studio for hours while he painted a design which
Keats suggested to him, and all the while he was telling me particulars
of his last days. His sufferings were terrible and prolonged. Shelley
and Hunt had deprived him of his belief in Christianity, which he wanted
in the end, and he endeavored to fight back to it, saying if Severn
would get him a Jeremy Taylor he thought he could believe; but it was
not to be found in Rome. Another time (which is to me peculiarly
painful, though it shows at the same time how little way he had
proceeded in a particular line of thought), having been betrayed into
considerable impatience by bodily and mental anguish, he cried, on
recovering himself, 'By God, Severn, a man ought to have some

wandered, and the questions were often disconnected and indistinct, but

occurred to attract notice during the early part of the night, but at

buried in his hands upon the pillow. The sad yet not unexpected truth
soon became evident: he had passed away on the furthest of all his

prayer&mdash;prayer offered in that reverential attitude about which he
was always so particular; com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167"

<p>So soon as the death of Livingstone was known to his men, they resolved
to carry their master's remains to Zanzibar. Arrangements were made for
drying and embalming the body, after removing the heart and other
viscera. For fourteen days the body was dried in the sun. After being
wrapped in calico, and the legs bent inward at the knees, it was
enclosed in a large piece of bark from a Myonga tree in the form of a
cylinder; over this a piece of sail-cloth was sewed; and the package was
lashed to a pole, so as to be carried by two men. Jacob Wainwright
carved an inscription on the Moula tree under which the body had rested,
and where the heart was buried, and Chitambo was charged to keep the
grass cleared away, and to protect two posts and a cross-piece which
they erected to mark the spot.</p>

<p>The remains were brought to Aden on board the "Calcutta," and thereafter
transferred to the steamer "Malwa," which arrived at Southampton on the
15th of April. Mr. Thomas Livingstone, eldest surviving son of the
Doctor, being then in Egypt on account of his health, had gone on board
at Alexandria. The body was conveyed to London by special train and
deposited in the rooms of the Geographical Society in Saville Row.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
In the course of the evening the remains were examined by Sir William
Fergusson and several other medical gentlemen, including Dr. Loudon, of
Hamilton, whose professional skill and great kindness to his family had
gained for him a high place in the esteem and love of Livingstone. To
many persons it had appeared so incredible that the remains should have
been brought from the heart of Africa to London, that some conclusive
identification of the body seemed to be necessary to set all doubt at
rest. The state of the arm, the one that had been broken by the lion,
supplied the crucial evidence. "Exactly in the region of the attachment
of the deltoid to the humerus" (wrote Sir William Fergusson in a
contribution to the <i>Lancet</i>, April 18, 1874), "there were the
indications of an oblique fracture. On moving the arm there were the
indications of an ununited fracture. A closer identification and
dissection displayed the false joint that had so long ago been so well
recognized by those who had examined the arm in former days.... The
first glance set my mind at rest, and that, with further examination,
made me as positive as to the identification of these remains as that
there has been among us in modern times one of the greatest men of the
human race&mdash;David Livingstone."</p>

<p>The late E. J. Glane, who crossed Africa in the interest of <i>The
Century</i>, makes the following entry in his journal:</p>

<p>July 9. To-day I revisited the tree where Livingstone <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>died, and
in order to guide others to the exact spot, in case this tree should
disappear from any cause, I selected another big tree likely to last
many years, cleared away two and a half square feet of its bark, and in
the space marked as follows: "This tree is magnetic southwest of the
tree where Livingstone's remains are buried, and is forty-five paces
from it." I brought away a bit of the bark of the memorable tree&mdash;a
dead part, so as not to be guilty of vandalism.<a name="FNanchor_29_29"

<p>Livingstone's grave is in a quiet nook, such as he himself desired, in
the outskirts of a forest bordering on a grass plain where the roan buck
and eland roam in safety. When I visited the place turtle-doves were
cooing in the tree-tops, and a litter of young hyenas had been playing
near by; in the low ground outside the hole leading to the cave were
their recent tracks; they had scampered into safety at our approach.</p>

recognized Cardinal de Rohan and said to him, "These are the graces of
the Church." Several times he repeated: "<i>Nunc et in hora mortis.</i>"
Then he said, "O God, come unto mine aid; O Lord, make haste to help
me." These were his last words. The agony was beginning. It lasted all
night, and on Sunday, September 1, 1715, at a quarter past eight in the
morning, Louis XIV., aged seventy-seven years lacking three days, during
sixty-two of which he had been a king, yielded his great soul to God.</p>

<p>A candle burning in the King's chamber, which was to be extinguished at
the same moment as the life of the King, was the signal agreed on for
the measures to be taken and the orders to be given as soon as he should
have breathed his last. The candle was put out at two o'clock in the
afternoon of May 10, 1774. Instantly a great tumult, comparable to a
clap of thunder, shook the arches of Versailles. It was the crowd of
courtiers leaving the antechambers of the dead man and noisily hastening
to meet the new monarch.</p>

The first blow of the executioner inflicted a ghastly wound on the
lower part of the skull. Not a scream nor groan, not a sigh escaped her,
but the convulsion of her features showed the horrible suffering caused
by the wound. The eye-witness of the execution, whose account is

down his axe, but missing the proper place, gave her a horrible blow
upon the upper extremity of the neck; but, with unexampled fortitude,
she remained perfectly still, and did not even heave a sigh. At the
second stroke the neck was severed and the head held up to the gaze of
bystanders with 'God save Queen Elizabeth!'"&mdash;<i>Meline's "Mary Queen

<p>When the psalm was finished she felt for the block, and laying down her
head muttered: "In manus, Domine, tuas commendo animam meam." The hard
wood seemed to hurt her, for she placed her hands under her neck. The
executioners gently removed them lest they should deaden the blow, and
then one of them, holding her slightly, the other raised the axe and
struck. The scene had been too trying even for the practised headsman of
the Tower. His arm wandered. The blow fell on the knot of the
handkerchief and scarcely broke the skin. She neither spoke nor moved.
He struck again, this time effectively. The head hung by a shred of
skin, which he divided without withdrawing the axe, and at once a
metamorphosis was witnessed strange as was ever wrought by wand of
fabled enchanter. The coif fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186"

illusion vanished; the lady who had knelt before the block was in the

a grizzled, wrinkled old woman.</p>

withdraw his army. Maximilian was embarrassed by want of money, and
offended the clerical party (which had favored him) by refusing to
restore the property of the Church, which had been confiscated by the
Liberals. The French troops departed about the end of 1866, after which

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Later in the day he uttered these memorable words:&mdash;"I carry in my
heart the dirge of the monarchy, the ruins whereof will now be the prey
of the factions."</p>

<p>His death, although that of a sceptic, had something in it sublime.
He was no stranger to his approaching dissolution; but, far from being
intimidated by the prospect, he gloried in the name he was to leave.
Hearing the cannon discharge upon some public event, he exclaimed, "I
already hear the funeral obsequies of Achilles&mdash;after my death, the
factions will tear to shreds the remnants of the <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>monarchy." His sufferings
were severe at the close of his illness: at one period, when the power
of speech was gone, he wrote on a slip of paper the words of Hamlet, "To
die is to sleep." "When a sick man is given over, and he suffers
frightful pains, can a friendly physician refuse to give him opium?" "My
pains are insupportable; I have an age of strength, but not an instant
of courage." A few hours before his death, the commencement of
mortification relieved his sufferings. "Remove from the bed," said he,
"all that sad apparatus. Instead of these useless precautions, surround
me with perfumes and the flowers of spring; dress my hair with care; let
me fall asleep amidst the sound of harmonious music." He then spoke for
ten minutes with such vivid and touching eloquence, that every one in
the room was melted into tears. "When I am no more," said he, "my worth
will become known. The misfortunes which I have held back will then pour
on all sides upon France; the criminal faction which now trembles before
me will be unbridled. I have before my eyes unbounded presentiments of
disaster. We now see how much we erred in not preventing the commons
from assuming the name of the National Assembly; since they gained that
victory, they have never ceased to show themselves unworthy of it. They
have chosen to govern the King, instead of governing by him; but soon
neither he nor they will rule the country, but a vile faction, which
will overspread it with horrors."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196"
id="Page_196">196</a></span> A spasm, attended with violent convulsions,
having returned, he again asked for laudanum. "When nature," said he,
"has abandoned an unhappy victim, when a miracle only can save his life,
how can you have the barbarity to let him expire on the wheel?" His feet
were already cold, but his countenance still retained its animation, his
eye its wonted fire, as if death spared to the last the abode of so much
genius. Feigning to comply, they gave him a cup, containing what they
assured him was laudanum. He calmly drank it off, fell back on his
pillow, and expired.</p>

honours. At night Nadir, whose only couch, for months past, had been a
horse-blanket, with a saddle for a pillow, was conducted to a
magnificent bed, with piles of cushions; and twelve young damsels were
in attendance to shampoo his limbs and fan him to sleep. Nadir started
from his luxurious couch, roared for his secretary, and gave orders that
the drums should be beat, and a proclamation made that Nadir had
conquered all India. The astonished scribe ventured to hint that this
conquest had not yet been accomplished. "No matter," said Nadir, "where
the chiefs of the people choose to live in this effeminate manner, it
will cost me little trouble to conquer them." And his anticipation was
fully verified. After he had taken the city of Delhi, he visited the
discomfited Emperor, who received him in fear and trembling. Nadir was
seated in the chair of state, and the attar of roses and other perfumes
were brought, according to custom and presented to him. Nadir had not
changed his clothes or taken off his armor for many days, and his person
was by no means free from vermin. He asked contemptuously what was the
use of perfuming a soldier's garments; and, thrusting his hand into his
bosom, drew forth a number of lice, which he told the astonished Emperor
were better companions than all his sweet scents. Nadir had ordered a
splendid mausoleum to be built for himself at Mush'hed, in Khorassan;
and on his return from India he went to see it. The night before he
visited his intended resting-place, some unfriendly wag<span

common salutation to a friend who had been long absent, "Your place has
been long empty." Nadir offered a reward for the discovery of the
writer, but never succeeded in finding out who he was. The place was not
long empty, for Nadir was assassinated soon after, and here his remains
rested till they were dug up and desecrated by Agha Mohammed.</p>

dragging Montholon, who endeavored to restrain him, on the floor. It was
the last effort of that formidable energy. He was with difficulty
replaced in bed by Montholon and Archambault, and then lay quietly till
near six o'clock in the evening, when he yielded his last breath. A
great storm was raging outside, which shook the frail huts of the
soldiers as with an earthquake, tore up the trees that the Emperor had
planted, and uprooted the willow under which he was accustomed to
repose. Within, the faithful Marchand was covering the corpse with the
cloak which the young conqueror had worn at Marengo.</p>

resolution to die. He devised every operatic incident of which he could
think. When even his most degraded slaves urged him to have sufficient
manliness to save himself from the fearful infamies which otherwise
awaited him, he ordered his grave to be dug, and fragments of marble to
be collected for its adornment, and water and wood for his funeral pyre,
perpetually whining: "What an artist to perish!" Meanwhile a courier
arrived for Phaon. Nero snatched his dispatches out of his hand, and
read that the Senate had decided that he should be punished in the
ancestral fashion as a public enemy. Asking what the ancestral fashion
was, he was informed that he would be stripped naked and scourged to
death with rods, with his head thrust into a fork. Horrified at this, he
seized two daggers, and after theatrically trying their edges, sheathed
them again, with the excuse that the fatal moment had not yet arrived!
Then he bade Sparus begin to sing his funeral song, and begged some one
to show him how to die. Even his own intense shame at his cowardice was
an insufficient stimulus, and he whiled away the time in vapid epigrams
and pompous quotations. The sound of horses' hoofs then broke on his
ears, and venting one more Greek quotation, he held the dagger to his
throat. It was driven home by Epaphroditus, one of his literary slaves.
At this moment the centurion who came to arrest him rushed in. Nero was
not yet dead, and under pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209"

stanch the wound with his cloak. "Too late," he said; "is this your
fidelity?" So he died; and the bystanders were horrified with the way in

<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Nourse</span> (Rebecca, a good
and brave woman who, in the old Puritan-days, suffered as a witch at
Salem, Mass.), 1621-1692. Her last words are not preserved, but it is
recorded that just before her death she declared her innocence and
appealed to the judgment of Almighty God. The story of her death forms
one of the saddest of the many distressing chapters in the history of
early New England.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nourse was a very devout woman, and probably the hardest blow of
all was the action of the First Congregational Church, of which she was
a member. The records still preserved read as follows:</p>

<p>"After Sacrament the elders propounded to the church, and it was by
unanimous vote consented to, that our Sister Nourse, being a convicted
witch, and condemned to die, be excommunicated, which was accordingly
done in the afternoon, she being present."</p>

<p>The scene presented on this occasion must have<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span> been as impressive at
the time, as it is shocking to us in the retrospect. The spacious
meeting-house was filled with people. The sheriff, accompanied by his
deputy brought in the prisoner, manacled, with the chains clanking from
her side. The two elders, Higginson and Noyes, as the clergy were then
called, delivered an address over the sorrow-burdened form condemning
her to eternal punishment.</p>

<p>Then came the day of execution, July 19, 1692. At an early hour the
little village was bristling with activity. "The devil's angel on earth"
was to be punished with the death she deserved, and so the Puritan
maidens attired themselves in holiday dress to honor the event. The
procession to the gallows was a long one, scores of people from the
neighboring towns and villages taking part. The victim, manacled and
guarded by the sheriff and his deputy, headed the line, while close
behind followed troops of men and women who laughed, deeming it rare
sport to see the agonized faces of the terror-stricken family as they
watched the mother and wife grow pale, and tremble as she began the
ascent of the rocky cliff whose top was crowned with the instrument of
death. It is impossible in words to depict the scene of the execution in
the horrible colors in which tradition has painted it. With firm steps
and eyes upturned to heaven, the gray-haired woman took her place on the
drop. Silently the hangman tied the rope before the eager waiting
assembly; then a momentary hush passed over the crowd<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>&mdash;the
executioner's duty was done. A moment later all that was left to tell
the story was the body of the aged woman swinging gently in the summer
wind.</p>

<p>Seldom has a woman met with a harder fate. Her body was thrown with
the previous victims into a hole in a crevice of the rocks, and hastily
covered with earth. Then the masses of spectators turned homeward,
leaving the bereaved family at the homestead uncared for and ignored by
their once firm friends.</p>

<p>It is a family tradition that in some way the remains of Mrs. Nourse
were recovered by her husband and sons and interred in the spot which is
now pointed out on the estate as her grave. Imagination only can recall
the details of the event, so sad and awful. In the darkness of night the
sons hasten to the new-made grave, throw off the slight covering of
earth, and by the feeble light of a lantern discover the remains. What
feelings of revenge and sorrow must have stirred their hearts as they
raised their mother's soulless frame tenderly in their arms, and carried
it along through woods and valleys, over highways and fields to the
homestead, where, on the following night, the three pronounced the only
burial service over the remains, as they lowered the body into a
newly-made grave in their own consecrated grounds, which down through
the generations has been reverently guarded.</p>

<p>A beautiful shaft of granite has been erected over her grave by her
descendants. The monument is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213"
id="Page_213">213</a></span> Rockport and Quincy granite, and is eight
and a half feet high. The base and apex are of Rockport granite, and the

recanted and became a Christian, while others affirm that he died as he
lived&mdash;an avowed Deist. In his last will and testament he says: "I
have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time has been spent
in doing good; and I die in perfect composure and resignation to the
will of my creator, God." On the other hand some authors say that he was
grossly intemperate and licentious, and that he discarded Christianity,
not so much from conviction as from a base desire to lead a bad life.</p>

<p>"In 1802, he (Paine) returned to America and resided a part of the time
on a farm at New Rochelle, presented to him by the State of New York for
his Revolutionary service. Paine became very intemperate, and fell low

Of Paine's last hours Rev. O. B. Frothingham speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"The truth is, that Paine, though not rich, was in comfortable
circumstances. He had considerable property, which is specified in his
will. His sick bed was surrounded by friends who ministered to his
wants, witnessed the firmness and calmness of his last hours, and
attested the sincerity and sufficiency of his convictions. Not even the
impertinent intrusiveness of the clergy disturbed the entire serenity of
his death."</p>

<p>The commonly received opinion, and most likely the correct one, with
regard to Paine is this which we excerpt from <i>Appleton's Cyclopædia of
Biography</i>:</p>

<p>"His attacks upon religion had exceedingly narrowed his circle of
acquaintance; and his habitual intemperance tended to the injury of his
health and the ultimate production of a complication of disorders, to
which he fell a victim in 1809. The Quakers refused to admit his remains
among their dead, and he was buried on his own farm. Cobbett boasted of
having disinterred him in 1817, and of having brought his body to
England; many, however, assert that Cobbett did not take that trouble,
but brought over from America the remains of a criminal who had been

<p>Palmer was a man of acute and affectionate feelings, which had been much
exercised by the course and events of his life. He had recently lost his
wife and a favorite son, labored in consequence under profound grief and
depression of mind which he strove to overcome, and had expressed a
conviction that these mental sufferings would very shortly bring him to
his grave. During some days he seemed, however, to bear up against his
misfortunes, and performed in some pieces, including <i>The Stranger</i>,
with much success. About a week afterward he appeared a second time in
that character, when he fell a victim to the poignancy of his feelings.
On the morning of the day he was much dejected, but exerted himself with
great effect in the first and second acts of the play. In the third act
he showed evident marks of depression; and in the fourth, when about to
reply to the question of Baron Steinfort relative to his children,
appeared unusually agitated. He endeavored to proceed, but his feelings
overcame him. The hand of death arrested his progress, and he fell on
his back, heaved a convulsive sigh and instantly expired without a
groan. Having been removed to the scene-room, and medical aid
immediately procured, his veins were opened, but yielded not a single
drop of blood, and every other means of resuscitation was tried without
effect. His death was by most persons ascribed to apoplexy; but Dr.

of tobacco, and two pipes on which shall be engraved my name, my crest,
and the date of my death. The poor of the neighborhood who accompany my
bier shall receive every year on the anniversary of my death a large
package of tobacco. I make the condition that all those who assist at my
funeral, if they wish to partake of the benefits of my will, must smoke
without interruption during the entire ceremony. My body shall be placed
in a coffin lined throughout with the wood of my old Havana cigar-boxes.
At the foot of the coffin shall be placed a box of French tobacco called
<i>Caporal</i> and a package of our old Dutch tobacco. At my side place my
favorite pipe and a box of matches, ... for one never knows what may
happen. When the bier rests in the vault, all the persons in the funeral
procession are requested to cast upon it the ashes of their pipes, as
they pass it on their departure from the grounds."</p>

<p>The wishes of the testator were fulfilled to the letter. The funeral
went off gloriously in dense clouds of smoke. Mr. Van Klaës' cook,

<p>A member of his congregation, a chemist, asked him to look at his
galvanic apparatus. He took the ends of the wire, completed the circuit,
experiencing the tingling. He then held the end of the wire to the back
of the head and neck, without a single sensation being elicited. Then he
touched his forehead for a second. "Instantly a crashing pain shot
through, as if my skull was stove in, and a bolt of fire were burning
through and through." In the same letter he writes, "My work is done."
Some hope might have been entertained if he could have had a curate to
help him with his work. But the then Vicar of Brighton, rather an
unsympathetic man, refused to let him have the curate on whom his heart
was set. So he sank, unrelieved, into death. The dark secrets of the
hospital of torture hardly reveal greater suffering than Robertson
endured in those last hours. When they sought to change his position, he
said, "I cannot bear it; let me rest. I must die. Let God do his work."
These were his last words.</p>

<p>He was only thirty-seven years old when he died; an age when he had
not reached the climax of his powers, or the complete development of his
character and views. It is an interesting circumstance that after his
death an inhabitant of Brighton who had stood aloof from his teaching
during his life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242"

with the beauty of his teaching that in gratitude he placed a marble
bust of the great preacher in the Pavilion.</p>

<p>For six years he continued to preach sermons, the like of which, for
blending of delicacy and strength of thought, poetic beauty and homely
lucidity of speech, had perhaps never been heard before in England.
Robertson was unhappily (for his comfort) not very "orthodox;"
consequently he was long misunderstood, and vilified by the "professedly
religious portion of society;" but so true, so beautiful was his daily
life and conversation that he almost outlived those pious calumnies, and
his death (from consumption) threw the whole town in

with freedom his hand, tongue and eyes. His days were passed in a chair

himself that his wife had to kneel to look in his face. He could not be
moved without screaming from pain, nor sleep without opium. The epitaph

became greater. He complained of a burning inward heat, and the first
and last tone of impatience broke from his lips: "Ah, Lord, I suffer
much!" The features of death came fully on, the eye was glazed, the
death-struggle was over! At this moment, he laid the two fore-fingers
upon his left eye, as he often did when in deep thought, and began to
speak: "We have the atoning death of Jesus Christ, his body and his
blood." During this he had raised himself up, his features began to be
reanimated, his voice became clear and strong; he inquired with priestly
solemnity: "Are ye one with me in this faith?" to which we, Lommatzsch
and a female friend who were present, and myself, answered with a loud
<i>yea</i>. "Then let us receive the Lord's Supper! but the sexton is not
to be thought of; quick, quick! let no one stumble at the form; I have
never held to the dead letter!"</p>

began&mdash;with features more and more animated, and with an eye to

with which he looked upon us, had returned,&mdash;to pronounce some
words of prayer introductory to the solemn rite. Then he gave the bread
first to me, then to the female friend, then to Lommatzsch, and lastly
to himself, pronouncing aloud to each, the words of institution (Matt.
xxvi, etc.; 1 Cor. xi. 23-29),&mdash;so loud indeed, that the children

and Muhlenfels (late Professor in the London University), who kneeled
listening at the door of the next room, heard them plainly. So also with
the wine, to us three first, and then to himself, with the full words of
institution to each. Then, with his eyes directed to Lommatzsch, he
said: "Upon these words of Scripture I stand fast, as I have always
taught; they are the foundation of my faith." After he had pronounced
the blessing, he turned his eye once more full of love on me, and then
on each of the others, with the words: "In this love and communion, we
are and remain <span class="smcap">one</span>."</p>

<p>He laid himself back upon his pillow; the animation still rested on his
features. After a few minutes he said: "Now I can hold out here no
longer," and then, "Lay me in a different posture." We laid him on his
side,&mdash;he breathed a few times,&mdash;and life stood still! Meanwhile

several fainting spells and during the day these continued at short

All day his condition grew worse, but he retained consciousness till

<p>It was believed that sacred as the tomb is always considered to be,
there were persons capable of rifling the grave in order to obtain the
head of the murdered Prophet for the purpose of exhibiting it, or
placing it in some phrenological museum&mdash;the skull of Joseph Smith
was worth money. This apprehension, in point of fact, proved true, for
the place where the bodies were supposed to be buried was disturbed the
night after the interment. The coffins had been filled with stones,
etc., to about the weight which the bodies would have been. The remains
of the two brothers were then secretly buried the same night by a chosen
few, in the vaults beneath the temple. The ground was then levelled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and pieces of rock and other <i>débris</i> were scattered carelessly over the
spot. But even this was not considered a sufficient safeguard against
any violation of the dead, and on the following night a still more
select number exhumed the remains, and buried them beneath the pathway
behind the Mansion House. The bricks which formed the pathway were
carefully replaced and the earth removed was carried away in sacks and
thrown into the Mississippi. If this last statement is true, the bodies
must have been removed a third time, as, since writing the above, the
author has it on unquestionable authority that they now repose in quite
a different place. Brigham Young has endeavored to obtain possession of
the remains of the Prophet, that they might be interred beneath the
temple at Salt Lake.</p>

In the last year of her life she secluded herself from the world, and
especially from the society of the other sex, and gave it out that she
was with child of the Holy Ghost; and that she would give birth to the
Shiloh promised to Jacob, which should be the second coming of Christ.
Her prophecy was that she was to be delivered on the 19th of October,
1814, at midnight; being then upwards of sixty years of age.</p>

<p>This announcement seemed not unlikely to be verified, for there was an
external appearance of pregnancy; and her followers, who are said to
have amounted at that time to 100,000, were in the highest state of
excitement. A splendid and expensive cradle was made, and considerable
sums were contributed in order to have other things prepared in a style
worthy of the expected Shiloh. On the night of the 19th of October a
large number of persons assembled in the street in which she lived,
waiting to hear the announcement of the looked-for event; but the hour
of midnight passed over, and the crowd were only induced to disperse by
being informed that Mrs. Southcott had fallen into a trance.</p>

themselves into a religious society which they called the Southcottian

<p class="section"><span class="smcap">Spinoza</span> (Baruch, his Hebrew
name which he translated into Latin as Benedictus), 1632-1677. There can
be no certainty with regard to the last hours of Spinoza. There was with
him at the time of his death but one friend who refused to make any
disclosure, and who chose to pass to his own grave in silent possession
of the secret. Nevertheless a report prevailed, and was for a time
believed, that Spinoza died in great fear and distress of mind, and that
with his last breath he cried out: "<i>God have mercy upon me, and be
gracious to me, a miserable sinner!</i>" Another report, equally without
foundation, represented the great Dutch philosopher as resorting to
suicide when he saw death drawing near.</p>

<p>Spinoza is regarded as the ablest of modern pantheistic philosophers.
Dugald Stewart goes so far as to call him an Atheist: "In no part of
Spinoza's works has he avowed himself an Atheist; but it will not be
disputed by those who comprehend the drift of his reasonings, that, in
point of practical tendency, Atheism and Spinozism are one and the
same." During his life he awakened in the minds of some of the ablest
men of letters and religion a bitter hatred it is now difficult to
understand. It is but fifty years ago that Karel Luinman, at that time
minister of the Reformed church at Middleburg, said: "Spit on that
grave&mdash;there lies Spinoza." Later Froude,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span> Lewes and Maurice have
described him as a calm, brave man who lived nobly, and confronted
disease and death with a deeply religious faith. Coleridge pronounced
the Pantheism of Spinoza preferable to modern Deism, which he held to be
but "the hypocrisy of Materialism." Schleiermacher vindicated the memory
of the great philosopher after the following fashion: "Offer up
reverently with me a lock of hair to the manes of the rejected but holy
Spinoza! The great Spirit of the Universe filled his soul; the Infinite
to him was beginning and end; the Universal his sole and only love.
Dwelling in holy innocence and deep humility among men, he saw himself
mirrored in the eternal world, and the eternal world not all unworthily
reflected back in him. Full of religion was he, full of the Holy Ghost;
and therefore it is that he meets us standing alone in his age, raised
above the profane multitude, master of his art, but without disciples
and the citizen's rights." Probably the truth of the matter is that
Spinoza was a man of pure, brave and simple life; of gentle disposition;
and of rare philosophical abilities and attainments; but whose system,
though possessed of much that is true and good, is yet essentially
opposed to God's revelation of himself in the sacred Scriptures, and in
the person of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Even people who lived in the same house with him never suspected how
rapidly death was approaching. He had come down, as he generally did in
the evening, and talked for a long time with his com<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>panions about the sermons
which they had just heard. That evening he went to bed earlier than
usual. The next day, February 23, 1677, he came once more downstairs,
before church-time to speak with his friends. In the meantime Dr. Ludwig
Meyer, of Amsterdam, to whom Spinoza had written, arrived. He gave his
suffering friend such medical assistance as he could; and, amongst other
orders, desired the landlady to kill a chicken, that Spinoza might have
some soup for dinner. This was done, and Spinoza ate the soup with a
good appetite. When Van der Spyck and his wife returned from the
afternoon service, they heard that Spinoza had died about three o'clock.
Nobody was with him in his last hours except the doctor from Amsterdam,
who went away again the same evening."</p>

Comète," and flashed through the Parisian world during the last year of
the Second Empire? She was called "Comet" on account of the exceeding
length and loveliness of her golden hair. Théophile Gautier wrote a
sonnet to her, Cabanel painted her portrait. Worth dressed her, and Léon
Cugnot took her as the model of his statue, "La Baigneuse." Her real
name was Adèle Terchout, and just before the Franco-German war broke out
she declined an offer of marriage from an elderly duke, with a very
ancient escutcheon. At that time she owned one of the finest mansions in
the Champs Elysées, had twelve horses in her stables and a bushel of
diamonds in her dressing-case. Last week this dazzling creature died in
a Parisian hospital absolutely destitute, and the disease which carried
her off was the most hideous that could befall a pretty woman&mdash;a lupus

should be able to do as much as the birds who build their own nests. The
entire house cost him less than thirty dollars; and in it he lived at an
expense of about twenty-seven cents a week. The house had neither lock
nor curtain, and was unprotected day and night. The door was seldom
closed, and the window was often wide-open in the midst of a winter
storm. "I am no more lonely," he wrote, "than Walden Pond itself. What

<p>There has been much discussion with regard to the character and work of
Damien. The Rev. C. M. Hyde. D. D., of Honolulu, a missionary of high
repute, and who had personal knowledge of the leper-<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>priest, wrote a
letter to the Rev. H. B. Gage, which was published in "The Sydney
Presbyterian" of October 26, 1889. In that letter he said:</p>

<p>"The simple truth is, he (Father Damien) was a coarse, dirty man,
headstrong and bigoted. He was not sent to Molokai, but went there
without orders; did not stay at the leper settlement (before he became
himself a leper), but circulated freely over the whole island (less than
half the island is devoted to the lepers), and he came often to
Honolulu. He had no hand in the reforms and improvements inaugurated,
which were the work of our Board of Health, as occasion required and
means were provided. He was not a pure man in his relations with women,
and the leprosy of which he died should be attributed to his vices and
carelessness. Others have done much for the lepers, our own ministers,
the government physicians, and so forth, but never with the Catholic
idea of meriting eternal life."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To the statements of Dr. Hyde, Robert Louis Stevenson replied in most
violent language, of which the following is a sample:</p>

<p>"You remember that you have done me several courtesies for which I was
prepared to be grateful. But there are duties which come before
gratitude, and offences which justly divide friends, far more
acquaintances. Your letter to the Rev. H. B. Gage is a document which,
in my sight, if you had filled me with bread when I was starving, if you
had set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
to nurse my father when he lay a-dying, would yet absolve me from the
bonds of gratitude."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>After this and more vituperation follows an analysis of Dr. Hyde's
letter, and an elaborate defense of Father Damien. Men will differ in
their opinions of the leper-priest, and, no doubt, much may be said on
both sides of the case; but to the compiler of this work, who, in his
own home, heard the story in all its details from the lips of Dr. Hyde,
the beatification of Damien is, to say the least, a grotesque absurdity.</p>

dying</i>," said to his valet.</p>

<p>According to a document discovered by Mr. Schuyler, American Consul
at Moscow, bearing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294"
id="Page_294">294</a></span> the death of Voltaire, and which was
forwarded to M. Taine, and published in the <i>Journal des Debats</i>,
the last words of Voltaire were, "Take care of Maria," meaning his
niece, Madame Denys. These words were addressed to one of his servants.</p>

<p>It has also been said that his last words were: "For the love of God,
don't mention that Man&mdash;allow me to die in peace!" to one who called
his attention to our Saviour.</p>

<p>There are several widely divergent accounts of the last hours of
Voltaire, and perhaps it is not possible to know just what measure of
truth is to be found in any one of them. It is said that on his
death-bed he cursed D'Alembert and denounced his infidel associates;
that he made in the presence of Abbé Gaultier, the Abbé Mignot, and the
Marquis de Villeveille a declaration of his wish to be reconciled to
"the church;" that he spent much time in alternately praying and
blaspheming. These facts, if facts they really are, rest upon the
statements of Mons. Tronchin, the Protestant physician from Geneva, who
attended him almost to the last, and who was so horrified at what he
witnessed that he said, "<i>Pour voir toutes les furies d'Oreste, il n'y
avait qu'a se trouver a la mort de Voltaire.</i>" The Marechal de
Richelieu, also, was terrified at what he saw and heard, and left the
bed-side of Voltaire declaring that his nerves were not strong enough to
endure the strain. Tronchin's statements are denied by Vilette and
Monke, who represent the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295"
id="Page_295">295</a></span> hours of the great Frenchman as calm and
peaceful. The exact truth will, it is most likely, never be known beyond
all question, and yet, to the compiler of this book, the weight of
evidence seems to be with Tronchin rather than with those who have
impeached his testimony.</p>

<p>His body was first placed in the family vault on the Mount Vernon
estate. In his will, Washington left directions and plans for a new
vault, which was built afterward, and to which his remains were
transferred in 1832. The front of his tomb has an ante-chamber, built of
red brick, about twelve feet in height, with a large iron gateway. It
was erected for the accommodation of two marble coffins, or sarcophagi,
one for Washington, the other for Mrs. Washington; they stand in full
view of the visitor. Over the gateway, upon a marble slab, are the

<p>He inquired whether it were likely that he should <span

eject blood from his stomach before death, and being told that it was
improbable, he asked, "Then what shall you do?" Being answered that he
would be supported by stimulants, and rendered as easy as possible by
the opiates that had suited him so well, he inquired, at once, if the
stimulant should not be given immediately; anxious again to know if the
hand of death were not already upon him. And on being told that it would
not be then given, he replied, "<i>When</i> you give it to me, I shall
know that I may drop off at once."</p>

<p>Being satisfied on this point, and that he should, therefore, have a
final warning, he said a moment afterwards, "I will, then, put myself in
a position to obtain a little repose." In this he was successful. He had
intervals of rest to the last; but on rousing from them he showed that
he was still intensely anxious to preserve his consciousness, and to
watch for the moment and act of his departure, so as to comprehend it.
Awaking from one of these slumbers, late in the night, he asked
distinctly if he were alive, and on being assured that he was, and that
his family was collected around his bed, he said in a perfectly natural
tone, as if assenting to what had been told him, because he himself
perceived that it was true, "I still live." These were his last coherent
and intelligible words. At twenty-three minutes before three o'clock,
without a struggle or a moan, all signs of life ceased to be visible.</p>

to a bell below. He would pull this rope after he became weak, and thus
ring the bell to attract attention. Prior to this time he had used his
heavy cane to pound the floor with. This brought assistance at once.
Just before he died, as the great change came over him&mdash;he was
conscious that it was a great change, a something unusual (Mrs. Davis
and Warry were by his side)&mdash;he seemed as if groping for something.

<p>On going to bed he felt very drowsy; and soon after the stupor of death
began to creep over him. He began to pray for all his dearest friends
individually; but his voice faltering, he could only say&mdash;"God bless
them all! The peace of God and of Jesus Christ overshadow them, dwell in
them, reign in them!" "My peace," said he, addressing his sister (the
peace I now feel), "Be with you!"&mdash;"Thou, O God, wilt keep him in
perfect peace whose <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310"
id="Page_310">310</a></span>mind is stayed on Thee." His speech again
began to fail, and he fell into a slumber; but whenever his senses were
recalled he returned to prayer. He repeated part of the Lord's prayer,
but was unable to proceed; and at last, with a composure scarcely
credible at such a moment, he whispered to the dear relative who hung
over his death-bed, "Close this eye, the other is closed already; and
now farewell!" Then, having again uttered part of the Lord's prayer, he
fell asleep.</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day, as Cavendish was watching near Wolsey,
he inquired the hour, and being told eight o'clock,&mdash;"That cannot be,"
he replied, "for at eight o'clock you will lose your master: my time is
at hand, and I must depart this world." His confessor, who was standing
near, requested Cavendish to enquire if he would be confessed. "What
have you to do with that?" answered the Cardinal, angrily; but was
appeased by the interference of the confessor. He continued to grow
weaker all that day: about four o'clock the next morning, he asked for
some refreshment, which having received, and made his final confession,
Sir William Kingston entered his room, and enquired how he felt himself:
"I tarry," said the dying man, "but the pleasure of God, to render up my
poor soul into His hands. I have now been eight days together troubled
with a continual flux and fever, a species of disease which, if it do
not remit its violence within that period, never fails to terminate in
death." Then follows his message to the King, concluding with, "Had I
served my God as diligently as I have served the King, He would not have
given me over in my grey hairs." He then continued, for a short time, to
give Sir William some advice, concluding with, "Forget not what I have
said; and when I am gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312"
id="Page_312">312</a></span> call it often to mind." Towards the
conclusion, his accents began to falter; at the end, his eyes became
motionless, and his sight failed. The abbot was summoned to administer
the extreme unction, and the yeomen of the guard were called to see him
die. As the clock struck eight he expired, on the 29th of November,
1530.</p>

<p>Great men may by their courage and virtue fortify us against the terrors
of death, if by their vices, and fears begotten of vices, they do not
distress us ten-fold more than we were distressed before; they may point
the way from a present twilight to the infinite day-dawn beyond; and yet
in the end must every pilgrim choose for himself the road over which he
is to journey. The foregoing pages give only the experiences of others.
Nevertheless, they may soften in our minds the dark outlines of the
landscape, and cast a ray of light into the great unseen. Happy is the
soul that in an age of doubt and uncertainty can trust, even though it
be with trembling faith, One greater than the greatest, and Who has
named Himself the Resurrection and the Life!</p>

href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Lablache
(1794-1858), the celebrated French singer and actor, whose wonderful
voice, embracing two full octaves, has been described as firmer and more
expressive than that of any singer of his time or before it, attempted
to sing upon his death-bed. He bade his son go to the piano and
accompany him. The young man, struggling with emotion, obeyed. Lablache
sang in English the first stanza of <i>Home, Sweet Home</i>. At the second
stanza the muscles of the throat refused to move; not a note could he
sound. In distress and great amazement he gazed around him for a moment,
and then, closing his eyes, fell asleep in death.</p>

<p>It is recorded of Captain Hamilton, whose portrait was painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, that he came to his death in this wise: "He imprudently
ventured in a boat from his ship to land at Plymouth, on a tempestuous
day, all in his impatience to rejoin his wife ashore. The boat turned
keel upwards, and the captain, being a good swimmer, trusted to his
skill, and would not accept of a place on the keel, but, that he might
leave room there for others, clung merely to the edge of the boat. His
great coat was a hindrance to him, and this he attempted to throw off;
but, in the words of Lord Eliot, whose too are the italics, 'finding his
strength fail, he told the men he must yield to his fate, and soon
afterwards sank while <i>singing a psalm</i>.'"&mdash;<i>Francis Jacox.</i></p>

<p>When Latour was guillotined at Foix, in 1864, for the murder of a family
of four persons, great was the throng in the streets, despite the heavy
rain that fell; for, to ensure a good attendance, the condemned man had
announced his intention to compose for the occasion a series of verses,
which he would sing on his way (in a cart, <i>vis-à-vis</i> with messieurs
the headsmen) from prison to scaffold. And sing them he did, all the
way&mdash;a matter of some three hundred and fifty yards. Lightly he tripped
up the steps of the scaffold, and then, after a deliberate survey of the
crowd below and all around, he thundered forth, <i>tonna</i>, the following
lines&mdash;a parody, or rather a personal appropriation, of the
Marseillaise:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Allons, pauvre victime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ton jour de mort est arrivé:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contre toi de la tyrannie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le couteau sanglant est levé!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Being then tied to the plank and flung into the usual horizontal
position in order to be brought under the blade, he still went
on&mdash;<i>Allons, pauvre victime</i>, <i>Ton jour de
mort</i> ... &mdash;until a heavy sound was heard, the blade fell,
something else fell with it, and all was
over.&mdash;<i>Jacox.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It is too early
for the last words of John Burroughs (may it be yet many years before
they are spoken), but we are struck with the wonderful accord between
the last words of Bolingbroke and the closing paragraph to the preface
with which Burroughs introduces his, "The Light of Day:" "I am content
to let the unseen powers go their own way with me and mine without
question or distrust. They brought me here, and I have found it well to
be here; in due time they will take me hence, and I have no doubt that
will be well for me too."</p></div>

href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Some have thought
it an evidence of strength of will to die standing; and some have even
wished to be buried in that posture. In Oliver Heywood's Register is the
following entry:&mdash;"Oct. 28, 1684. Captain Taylor's wife, of
Brighouse, buried in her garden, with head upwards, standing upright, by
her husband, daughter, and other Quakers."</p>

<p>Mrs. George S. Norton, of Pawling, N. Y., was buried at her own request
sitting upright in a rocking chair enclosed in a box made of seasoned
chestnut. The funeral services were held July 27, 1899.&mdash;<i>Albany
Argus.</i></p>

<p>M. Halloin of the neighborhood of Caen, in Normandy, who died in the
early part of this century, when he felt his end approach inserted in
his last will a clause expressing his desire to be buried at night, in
his bed, comfortably tucked in, with pillows and coverlets as he had
died. As no opposition was raised against the execution of this clause,
a huge pit was sunk, and the corpse was lowered into its last resting
place, without any alteration having been made in the position in which
death had overtaken him. Boards were laid over the bed, that the falling
earth might not disturb this imperturbable quietist.&mdash;<i>S.
Baring-Gould: "Curiosities of Olden Times."</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> There is a
story which comes to us from Scioppius, that Bruno rejected "with a
terrible menacing countenance" a crucifix which was held up to him, and
which may have been heated red hot, as was customary, in order to
convince the spectators of the sufferer's impiety, and prevent them from
feeling pity for him in his distress. The story has no very good
foundation, but we know that heated crucifixes were not uncommon among
the ghostly persecutors of earlier and darker days; and we can easily
see how a man asked to kiss such a crucifix might exhibit "a terrible
menacing countenance."</p></div>

Appendix of Allan Cunningham's "Life of Burns" we read of an examination
of the poet's Tomb, made immediately after that life was published:</p>

<p>"When Burns's Mausoleum was opened in March, 1834, to receive the
remains of his widow, some residents in Dumfries obtained the consent of
her nearest relative to take a cast from the cranium of the poet. This
was done during the night between the 31st of March and 1st of April.
Mr. Archibald Blacklock, surgeon, drew up the following description:</p>

<p>"The cranial bones were perfect in every respect, if we except a little
erosion of their external table, and firmly held together by their
sutures, &amp;c., &amp;c. Having completed our intention [<i>i. e.</i>,
of taking a plaster cast of the skull, washed from every particle of
sand, &amp;c.], the skull securely closed in a leaden case, was again
committed to the earth, precisely where we found it."</p></div>

1881, in the tranquil exhaustion of a ripe old age, this true
<span class="smcap">Sage</span> of modern times passed away at his home
in Cheyne Row, Chelsea, where he had lived for fifty years:
and,&mdash;as the <i>Times</i> remarked,&mdash;the world seemed duller,
colder, and darker, in that this one grey old man had left it.</p>

<p>No time was lost in collecting funds to provide for a public monument of
the philosopher. The work was entrusted to Mr. J. E. Boehm, R.A., with
the result of a most admirable statue in bronze, life-size, representing
Carlyle as he was in his latter days, in an attitude of thought, seated
in an arm-chair, and wearing his well-known dressing-gown. "For this
noble piece of portraiture," Mr. Ruskin wrote of it, "I cannot trust
myself to express my personal gratitude, or to speak at all of the high
and harmonious measure in which it seems to me to express the mind and
features of my dear master." It is appropriately placed in the little
public garden, at the end of Great Cheyne Row, Chelsea, where Carlyle
had spent the last forty years of his life. There, on October 26th,
1882, in presence of many of those who were his attached friends in
life, it was unveiled by Professor Tyndall, who delivered an eloquent
address on the occasion. Among those who assisted were Lord Houghton,
Mrs. Oliphant, Miss Swanwick, Moncure D. Conway, Robert Browning, Dr.
Martineau, Mr. W. E. H. Lecky, and others. A simple inscription on the
massive pedestal, of Aberdeen granite, records the dates of the birth
and death of the remarkable man in whose honour it is erected.&mdash;<i>William

href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> I mention the
discovery of the body of Charles I. when George IV. was Prince Regent.
It has been asserted, and is, I believe, true, that the nation wished
the body of him whom they always called "the saint and martyr" to be
removed from Windsor and buried in Westminster Abbey: and that a sum of
no less than £70,000 was entrusted by Parliament to Charles II. to erect
a tomb over the remains of his father. If the story be true, the entire
sum disappeared and was not put to the intended purpose. It was,
however, supposed that the "White King's" <i>coffin</i>, at any rate, had
been transferred to the Abbey. It was in order to settle a doubt on this
point that George IV., then Prince Regent, went down into the vaults of
Windsor with the famous physician, Sir Henry Halford. There they found
the coffins of Henry VIII. and of his wife, Lady Jane Seymour; and
between them lay a coffin on which were rudely scratched the letters "C.
I." In order to be sure that this was indeed the coffin of the executed
king, they opened it&mdash;and there lay before them the handsome face,
just as Vandyke depicted it; though (as always happens in such cases)
the nose fell in immediately that the corpse was exposed to the open
air. Then&mdash;I simply tell the tale as it was told to me; for, though
there must be some printed account of the event, I have never seen
it&mdash;Sir Henry Halford took up by the hair the decapitated head, and
placed it on the palm of his hand, which was covered by his silk
handkerchief. When he replaced the head in the coffin the vertebra of
the neck, which had been smoothly severed by the axe of the executioner,
was lying on his handkerchief; and the Prince Regent remarked to Sir
Henry that this would be an interesting relic for him. He took it; and
had it set in gold with the inscription, "Os Caroli Primi, heu
intercisum." I believe that, by the wish and right-feeling of H. R. H.
the Prince of Wales, this relic of the hapless king has been replaced in
the coffin. Everyone will recall the sanguinary epigram of Lord Byron
upon the incident which I have narrated.&mdash;<i>Farrar.</i></p></div>

of St. Bartholomew lasted seven days, during which more than 5,000
persons were slain in Paris, and about 50,000 in the country. During all
this season of murder, the king betrayed neither pity nor remorse, but
fired with his long gun at the poor fugitives across the river; and on
viewing the body of Coligni on a gibbet, he exulted with a fiendish
malignity. In early life this monster had been noted for his cruelty:
nothing gave him greater pleasure than cutting off the heads of asses or
pigs with a single blow from his couteau de chasse. After the massacre,
he is said to have contracted a singularly wild expression of feature,
and to have slept little and waked in agonies. He attributed his thirst
for human blood to the circumstance of his mother having at an early
period of his life familiarized his mind with the brutal sport of
hunting bullocks, and with all kinds of cruelty.&mdash;<i>Winslow's

in Corsica that when St. Pantaleon was beheaded, the <i>caput mortuum</i>, as

<p>A reliable gentleman who witnessed an execution, wrote as follows: "It
appears to be the best of all modes of inflicting the punishment of
death, combining the greatest impression on the spectator with the least
possible suffering to the victim. It is so rapid that I should doubt
whether there was any suffering; but from the expression of the
countenance, when the executioner held up the head, I am inclined to
believe that sense and consciousness may remain for a few seconds after
the head is off. The eyes seemed to retain speculation for a moment or
two, and there was a look in the ghastly stare with which they stared
upon the crowd, which implied that the head was aware of its ignominious
situation."</p></div>

of February, in the 30th year of Queen Mary, was Cranmer, Archbishop of
Canterbury, brought to the stake, where he first thrust his right hand
into the fire (with which he had before subscribed a recantation) till
it first, and then his whole body was consumed; but what was most
remarkable, his heart remained whole, and was not once touched by the
fire.&mdash;<i>Baker's Chron. p. 463.</i></p>

<p>We have the same story about the heart of Zuinglius. Three days after it
had been cast into the fire to be burned to ashes some friends found it
untouched by the flames.&mdash;<i>Melch. Adam. Vit. p. 37.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. J. C. Jeaffreson</span> in his book 'The
Real Shelley' writes: 'All the world knows how Shelley's torn and
disfigured corpse was reduced to ashes and a few fragments of bone (with
the exception of the heart that would <i>not</i> be burnt) on the pyre;' and
probably, since Trelawny, shortly after the poet's death, reported that
'his heart remained entire,' his statement has been unhesitatingly
accepted. I have, however, reason for thinking that the story does not
rest on trustworthy evidence.</p>

<p>"When a body is burnt the part which longest resists the action of the
fire after the base of the skull and one or two of the most solid
portions of bone, is the liver. The heart, being hollow and smaller, is
easily destroyed: but the liver, a moist and solid mass, repels intense
heat, and ultimately deposits an ash of pure carbon, which no continued
burning or increase of temperature can further change. In the cemetery
of Milan where I have seen human cremations completely carried out in
seventy minutes by Signor Venini's reverberatory furnace, the best
method known, I also learned that the liver, perhaps from its containing
this element of carbon, can endure for a considerable time even that
concentrated whirlwind of fire, and remain almost intact after the heart
has totally disappeared. Moreover, in Shelley's case the liver would
have been saturated with sea-water, and thereby rendered still more
incombustible. It is extremely improbable that Byron, Leigh Hunt, or
Trelawny knew enough anatomy to identify accurately the charred
substance they took to be the heart, and it is more likely, owing to the
thin edge of the liver being consumed, and its size consequently being
much reduced, that they mistook the shrunken remains of the one organ
for the whole of the other.</p>

<p>"From observing the Milanese cremations alluded to I think it barely
possible that the human heart is ever capable of withstanding fire for
more than a brief period; but since Mr. J. A. Symonds asserts, to my
surprise, that Shelley's heart was given by Leigh Hunt to Mrs. Shelley,
and is now at Boscombe, the seat of the present baronet, it would be
easy for some competent anatomist to determine the question I have
raised.</p>

<p>"In any case, the hero-worshipping and sentimental tourists who go in
crowds to that lovely spot beneath the pyramid of Caius Cestius to mourn
over Shelley's untimely fate have been strangely deceived for more than
sixty years in believing that beneath the marble graven with the
touching words 'Cor Cordium' lies the flame proof heart of their
favorite poet."&mdash;<i>Bicknell.</i></p></div>

of Spain, seems to have entertained the same morbid desire for a
personal acquaintance with his own <i>postmortem</i> appearance and
condition. In Robertson's History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V.
we have this account of the monarch's attendance upon his own funeral:
"He resolved to celebrate his own obsequies before his death. He ordered
his tomb to be erected in the chapel of the monastery. His domestics
marched thither in funeral procession, with black tapers in their hands.
He himself followed in his shroud. He was laid in his coffin with much
solemnity. The service for the dead was chanted, and Charles joined in
the prayers which were offered up for the rest of his soul, mingling his
tears with those which his attendants shed, as if they had been
celebrating a real funeral. The ceremony closed with sprinkling holy
water on the coffin in the usual form, and all the assistants retiring,
the doors of the chapel were shut. Then Charles rose out of the coffin,
and withdrew to his apartment, full of those awful sentiments which such
a singular solemnity was calculated to inspire." This story is somewhat
changed in Stirling's "Cloister Life of the Emperor Charles V."</p>

instructions were probably ignored; for, when his tomb was opened by the
Society of Antiquaries in 1771, those present gazed for a moment on the
features of the great victor before they sank into dust. The gold cloth
was still folded round the colossal corpse; and the cast in the eyes was
distinctly noticeable. The snow-white hair still remained. The coffin
was then filled with pitch.&mdash;<i>Farrar.</i></p>

<p>John Zisca, general of the insurgents who took up arms in 1419 against
the Emperor Sigismund, seems to have had a like spirit with Edward I. He
would revenge the deaths of John Huss and Jerome of Prague, who had been
cruelly burned at the stake for their religious faith. He defeated the
Emperor in several pitched battles, and gave orders that, after his
death, they should make a drum out of his skin. The order was most
religiously obeyed, and those very remains of the enthusiastic Zisca
proved, for many years, fatal to the Emperor, who, with difficulty, in
the space of sixteen years, recovered Bohemia, assisted by the forces of
Germany. The insurgents were 40,000 in number, and well disciplined.</p></div>

town of Concord is greatly stirred up over the discovery of a dastardly
attempt on Saturday night to rob the last resting place of its noted
dead, the grave of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The fact that the grave had been
visited by vandals was discovered early Sunday afternoon by a visitor to
Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, where the remains are interred. At the head of
the grave was a large aperture seven feet in depth and twenty inches
wide extending to the box containing the casket.</p>

<p>An alarm was at once given, and the town authorities, together with the
Sleepy Hollow Commissioners, made an investigation. The perpetrators of
the deed have not been discovered, but the theory is that the attempted
vandalism was made some time during Saturday night, and the villains
were frightened away by some passing team on the Bedford road just
adjacent. Whether the motive was to obtain possession of the remains, or
to despoil the casket of its valuable trimmings, is, of course, a matter
of conjecture; but the general impression is that the skull was what was
most wanted. The wooden box inclosing the casket had decayed somewhat,
the interment having taken place over seven years ago, and in the earth
which the rascals had thrown out were some pieces of the box. One side
of the casket had fallen down a little, but this is attributable to
natural decay. Otherwise the casket had not been disturbed or opened.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward W. Emerson, son of Ralph Waldo, arrived home this afternoon,
and the investigation of the desecration of his father's grave was
immediately entered upon by him with the town authorities. Mr. Emerson
has been out of town for two weeks or more, and the first information he
had of the affair was that given him upon his arrival this noon. The
earth has been replaced, and a watch placed over the grave.</p>

Siam is sending an envoy to India to receive the relics of Buddha,
discovered some time ago on the Nepal frontier, which were offered his
Majesty by the Indian Government. The King, who gratefully accepted the
offer, has agreed to distribute portions of the relics among the
Buddhists of Burma and Ceylon from Bangkok. It will probably be
remembered that in January last a well-preserved stupa was opened at the
village of Piprahwa, on the Nepal frontier, in the Basti district of the
North-west Provinces. This village was in the Birdpur grant, a large
property owned by Mr. William C. Peppé and his brother. Inside the
building was found a large stone coffer, crystal and steatite vases,
bone and ash relics, fragments of lime, plaster, and wooden vessels, and
a large quantity of jewels and ornaments placed in two vases in honor of
the relics. A careful list was at once made of all the articles, and Mr.
Peppé generously offered to place them at the disposal of the
Government. The special interest of the discovery lies in the fact that
the relics in honor of which the stupa was erected appear to be those of
Gautama Buddha Sakya Muni himself, and may be the actual share of the
relics taken by the Sakyas of Kapilavastir at the time of the cremation
of Gautama Buddha.</p>

<p>The inscription on one of the urns proves that the builders of the stupa
believed the relics to be those of Gautama Buddha himself, and runs:
"This relic-receptacle of the Blessed Sakya Buddha is dedicated by the
renowned brethren with their sisters and their sons' wives." The
characters of the record, Prof. Bührer points out, do not mark medial
long vowels, and appear to be older than those of the Asoka inscription.</p>

<p>The actual relics, being a matter of such intense interest to the
Buddhist world, were offered by the Indian Government to the King of
Siam, who is the only existing Buddhist monarch, with a proviso that he
would not object to offer a portion of the relics to the Buddhists of
Burma and Ceylon, and it was suggested that his Majesty should send a
deputation to receive the sacred relics with due ceremonial.</p>

<p>No relics of Buddha authenticated by a direct inscription have before
been found in modern times, so the relics are as rare as they are
unique, and by all Buddhists will be regarded as most sacred and holy
objects of devotion. Their presentation to the King of Siam, the
recognized head of the religion, is therefore highly proper. The
accessories which were discovered will, it is understood, be distributed
among the Imperial Museum at Calcutta, the Lucknow Provincial Museum,
and perhaps the British Museum, Mr. Peppé retaining a reasonable number
of duplicates for his own use. The stone coffer above referred to is
over four feet in length and two in height. It is made out of a solid
block of sandstone, and weighs about sixteen hundredweight. It is
understood that the acknowledgments of the Government have been conveyed
to Mr. Peppé for his public-spirited action in the matter.&mdash;<i>London

soon rendered his mouth incurably gangrened, and deprived him of the

stretched upon the funeral pile and burned alive.</p>

<p>Fabius, the Roman praetor, died from the same cause that occasioned the
death of Anacreon. A single goat hair in the milk he was drinking,
lodged in his trachea and choked him. Chalchas, the soothsayer, outlived
the time predicted for his death, which struck him as so comical that he
burst into a fit of most immoderate laughter from which he died. Thus
also died the famous Marquette, who was convulsed with a fatal merriment
on seeing a monkey trying to pull on a pair of boots. Philomenes was
seized with an equally disastrous merriment when he came suddenly upon
an ass that was devouring with greediness the choice figs that had been
prepared for his own desert.</p>

<p>Laughter killed the great Zeuxis, of whom Pliny relates the story of a
trial of skill with the painter Parrhasius. The former painted a bunch
of grapes that were so natural a bird endeavored to eat the fruit.

ran under the monarch's horse causing it to stumble. But of all strange

toiling in the harvest field, because, in obedience to the rule of St.
Patrick, he would not drink "a drop of anything."</p></div>

by which her personalty, sworn under £10,000, is suitably divided among
her brothers and sisters, an old servant, and a few friends, contains
one peculiar provision which indicates the desire of the testatrix, even
when dead, to benefit the living. "It is my desire," she says, "from an
interest in the progress of scientific investigation, that my Skull
should be given to Henry George Atkinson, of Upper Gloucester Place,
London, and also my Brain, if my death should take place within such
distance of his then present abode, as to enable him to have it for the
purposes of scientific observation." By the second codicil, dated
October 5th, 1872, this direction is revoked; "but," the codicil
proceeds, "I wish to leave it on record that this alteration in my
testamentary directions is not caused by any change of opinion as to the
importance of scientific observation on such subjects, but is made in
consequence merely of a change of circumstances in my individual case."
The "circumstances" alluded to were doubtless these. When the removal of
Miss Martineau to London took place, the "Burke and Hare" murders, and
"body-snatching" generally, were the special horrors of the day. The
only authorized supply of "subjects" for dissection was from the
gallows; and philanthropic persons sought by selling the reversion of
their bodies (a transaction which, legally, does not hold good), or like
Jeremy Bentham, leaving them to some institution, or medical expert, by
a special bequest (also nugatory), to dissolve the association of
disgrace with the necessary procedure of dissection. The difficulty was,
in great measure, relieved by the passing of Mr. Warburton's Bill; and
hence the necessity for such an arrangement as that made by Miss
Martineau ceased to exist. The singular provision, had however, become
known; and shortly after the execution of the document, the testatrix
received a letter from the celebrated aurist, Mr. Toynbee, asking her
point-blank to bequeath him a "legacy of her ears." She had suffered
from deafness all her life; a large amount of mischief and misery was
caused by the ignorance of surgeons with regard to the auditory
apparatus; and this ignorance could only be removed by such means as he
proposed. The lady to whom this strange request was made, says with grim
humour, that she felt "rather amused when she caught herself in a
feeling of shame, as it were, at having only one pair of ears,&mdash;at
having no duplicate for Mr. Toynbee, after having disposed otherwise of
her skull." She, however, told him how the matter actually stood; and a
meeting took place between the doctor and the legatee, "to ascertain
whether one head could, in any way, be made to answer both their
objects."</p>

<p>An autopsy of her body was eventually made by Dr. T. M. Greenhow, of
Leeds; a full detail of the appearances at which will be found in the
<i>British Medical Journal</i>, for April 14th, 1877, p. 449.&mdash;<i>William Bates

the actress, is mentioned by Lamartine as one of the Goddesses, who was
compelled to play the part much against her will. "Chaumette, assisted
by Laïs, an actor of the Opera, had arranged the fête of December 20,
1793. Mademoiselle Maillard, an actress, brilliant with youth and
talents, played the part of the goddess. She was borne in a palanquin,
the canopy of which was formed of oak branches. Women in white, with
tri-colored sashes, preceded her. Attired with theatrical buskins, a
Phrygian cap and a blue chlamys over a transparent tunic, she was taken
to the foot of the altar and seated there. Behind her burnt an immense
torch, symbolizing 'the flame of philosophy,' the true light of the
world. Chaumette, taking a censer in his hands, fell on his knees to the
goddess, and offered incense, and the whole concluded with dancing and
song."&mdash;<i>Lamartine.</i></p>

<p>There was also a Goddess of Liberty. The wife of Momoro went attended by
the municipal officers, national guards and troops of ballet girls to
the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. Gobet (the archbishop of Paris),
and nearly all the bishops, vicars, canons, priests, and curés of Paris
stripped themselves of their canonicals, donned the red nightcap, and
joined in this blasphemous mockery.</p></div>

Bentham, when he firmly believed that he was near his last hour, said to
one of his disciples, who was watching over him:&mdash;"I now feel that
I am dying. Our care must be to minimize the pain. Do not let any of the
servants come into the room, and keep away the youths. It will be
distressing to them, and they can be of no service. Yet I must not be

reduced the pain to the least possible amount."</p>

<p>Bentham dreaded the silence and darkness of the grave, and wished to
remain even after his death in a world of living men. He left his body
to Dr. Southwood Smith who was to perform certain experiments to
ascertain that no life remained. After these experiments the following
disposition was to be made of his remains: "The skeleton Dr. Smith shall
cause to be put together in such manner that the whole figure may be
seated in a chair usually occupied by me when living, in the attitude in
which I am sitting when engaged in thought in the course of the time
employed in writing. I direct that the body, thus prepared, shall be
transferred to my executor, and that he shall cause the skeleton to be
clothed in one of the suits of black usually worn by me. The body so
clothed, together with the chair and the staff in my later years borne
by me, he shall take charge of, and for containing the whole apparatus
he shall cause to be prepared an appropriate box or case, and shall
cause to be engraved in conspicuous characters on a plate to be affixed
thereon, and also in the glass case in which the preparations of the
soft parts of my body shall be contained, as, for example, in the manner
used in the case of wine decanters; my name at length with the letters
<i>ob</i>: followed by the day of my decease. If it should so happen that my
personal friends and other disciples should be disposed to meet together
on some day, or days of the year for the purpose of commemorating the
founder of the Greatest Happiness System of Morals and Legislation, my
executor shall cause to be conveyed into the room in which they meet the
case with its contents."</p>

were a number of roses and vines, as his last resting place. On the

leaving tapers burning beside it retired to rest. Sleep, however,
visited him not, and suddenly, breaking the silence, he heard first a
rustling, then a plunge in the water of the basin, then a fall with a
rebound on the floor, all in quick succession. Springing from his couch,
the physician saw an enormous rat dragging Bonaparte's heart to its

of alteration in the church at Twickenham, England, or burial of some
one in the same spot, the coffin of Pope was disinterred, and opened to
see the state of the remains. By a bribe to the sexton of the time,
possession of the skull was obtained for the night, and another skull

management of this transaction. Whether this account is correct or not,
the fact is that the skull of Pope figures in a private

<p>The head of the celebrated Duc de Richelieu, like that of Pope, the
Mahdi, and Swendenborg, is above ground. At the time of the revolution
in France the body of the Duke was exhumed from its grave in the Church
of the Sorbonne. This having been subjected to numerous indignities,
the head was cut off, and the latter eventually came into the possession
of a grocer, who afterward sold it to M. Armez, the elder. M. Armez,
after the Restoration, offered the head to the then Duc de Richelieu,
the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who took no notice whatever of the
offer. The son of M. Armez inherited the skull. In 1846 the illustrious
Montalembert, when President of the Historical Committee of Arts and
Monuments, at the instance of his colleagues, did his best to recover
the head of the Duke, but without success. M. F. Feuillet de Conches, in
his "Causeries d'un Curieux," makes this comment: "We accuse no one,
still the fact is undeniable that this terrible head, the
personification of the absolute monarchy killing the aristocratic
monarchy, is wandering upon the earth like a spectre that has straggled

$450 a year; and during the last six months of his life he smoked an
average of forty cigarettes per day, and often as many as eighty in
twenty-four hours. Can any one wonder that this frightful habit induced
chronic insomnia, to cure or lessen which he smoked all night, till
narcosis of the brain brought on stupefaction and temporary loss of
consciousness&mdash;for weeks his nearest approach to refreshing
slumber. His physician warned him in vain that he was burning life's

the heart, it is believed, was first described by Harvey; but since his
day several cases have been observed. Morgagni has recorded a few
examples: Amongst them that of George II., who died suddenly, of this
disease in 1760; and, what is very curious, Morgagni himself fell a
victim to the same malady. Dr. Elliotson, in his Lumleyan Lecture on
Diseases of the Heart, in 1839, stated that he had only seen one
instance; but in the Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine, Dr. Townsend
gives a table of twenty-five cases, collected from various authors.
Generally this accident is consequent upon some organic disease, such as
fatty degeneration; but it may arise from violent muscular exertion, or
strong mental emotions.&mdash;<i>Welby: "Mysteries of Life, Death and
Futurity."</i></p>

<p>Dr. William Stroud endeavors to prove, in his "The Physical Cause of the
Death of Christ," that our Saviour died upon the cross from rupture of
the heart, produced by agony of mind. He says: "In the garden of
Gethsemane Christ endured mental agony so intense that, had it not been
limited by divine interposition, it would probably have destroyed his
life without the aid of any other sufferings; but having been thus
mitigated, its effects were confined to violent palpitation of the
heart, accompanied with bloody sweat. On the cross this agony was
renewed, in conjunction with the ordinary sufferings incidental to that
mode of punishment; and having at this time been allowed to proceed to
its utmost extremity without restraint, occasioned sudden death by
rupture of the heart, intimated by a discharge of blood and water from
his side, when it was afterward pierced with a spear."</p></div>

was buried in the vault of the Swedish Church in Prince's Square, on
April 5, 1772. In 1790, in order to determine a question raised in
debate, viz., whether Swedenborg was really dead and buried, his wooden
coffin was opened, and the leaden one was sawn across the breast. A few
days after, a party of Swedenborgians visited the vault. "Various
relics" (says White: "<i>Life of Swedenborg</i>," 2nd ed., 1868, p. 675)
"were carried off: Dr. Spurgin told me he possessed the cartilage of an
ear. Exposed to the air, the flesh quickly fell to dust, and a skeleton
was all that remained for subsequent visitors.... At a funeral in 1817,
Granholm, an officer in the Swedish Navy, seeing the lid of Swedenborg's
coffin loose, abstracted the skull, and hawked it about amongst London
Swedenborgians, but none would buy. Dr. Wählin, pastor of the Swedish
Church, recovered what he supposed to be the stolen skull, had a cast of
it taken, and placed it in the coffin in 1819. The cast which is
sometimes seen in phrenological collections is obviously not
Swedenborg's: it is thought to be that of a small female skull."</p></div>

deceived, both I and they; for this carcass must be burnt to ashes, and

but a jest at the cruel torment and death now at hand prepared for

his curious book. "<i>The Three Principles</i>," where it is described as
that of "a blue vapor going forth out of the mouth of a dying man, which

that when the vital flame was flickering, the heart was faltering with
every pulse, and every breath was a convulsion, he said to a dying
believer, who had not long before been talking in broken words of
undying love, "Are you in pain?" and the reply, with apparently the last
breath, was, "It is delightful!" In another person, in whom a gradual
disease had so nearly exhausted the physical powers that the darkness of
death had already produced blindness, the sense of God's love was so
overpowering, that every expression for many hours referred to it in
rapturous words, such as, "This is life&mdash;this is heaven&mdash;God
is love&mdash;I need not faith&mdash;I have the promise." It is easy to
attribute such expressions to delirium; but this does not alter their
character, nor the reality of the state of the soul which produces them.
Whether a dying man can maintain any continued attention to things
through his senses, we need not inquire. It is enough for him, if, in
the spirit, he possesses the peace and joy of believing.&mdash;<i>The Use

that not a drop of coffee in the cup which he held in his hand was
spilt. He was sitting in his chair at a social meal with his friends,
Monsieur and Madame Berthollet, and Gay Lussac. Dr. Joseph Black, also a
famous physician, died whilst eating his customary meal of bread and
milk, and so quiet and peaceful was his departure that he did not even

Wordsworth died April 23rd, 1850, at the age of 80, and was buried in
the little centry-garth of St. Oswald's, Grasmere, between, as De
Quincey records, "a yew-tree of his own planting, and an aged thorn." On
his tombstone is an inscription from the pen of Keble, in which he is
styled, "a chief minister, not only of noblest poesy, but of high and
Sacred truth." Surely the tender lover of Nature, and high-priest of her
mysteries, could have no fitter resting-place than this Westmoreland
churchyard, where, as some one has written, "the turf is washed green by
summer dew, and winter rain, and in early spring is beautifully dappled
with lichens and golden moss?" This reads very prettily, and represents
the thing as it should be. But what are the facts? The literary pilgrim
who may chance to visit the spot will follow a narrow muddy path among
the grave mounds, till he reaches a gloomy dingy corner, with a group of
blue-black head-stones of funereal slate. Everything round the place is
decayed and blighted; no green grass is there; all is dull, dark and
depressing. The poet's corner is ill-drained; and there is a tiny moat
of water round the base of the stone curb, in which is fixed the iron
railing that surrounds the grave. Yet here is a remarkable group of
memorial tombs. Near to the poet lie all the beloved members of his
household. Here slumbers his favorite sister, Dorothy; here, too, Mrs.
Wordsworth,&mdash;Dora Wordsworth,&mdash;her husband, Edward Quillinan,
the poet, and translator of the <i>Lusiad</i>,&mdash;the two infant children
of Wordsworth,&mdash;and behind these, Hartley Coleridge, that
"inheritor of unfulfilled renown," whose bier the poet followed one
snowy day in January, unwitting that, before the trees were again clad
with verdure, he would be borne along the same narrow path to his own
long rest. Surely something should be done to rescue the poet's monument
from decay, and render it more in accordance with the verdant foliage
and the sun-bright hills around, of which he sung so lovingly and so
well.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
